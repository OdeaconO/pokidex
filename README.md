# Pokédex App 🔍⚡

A **Pokédex web app** built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/).  
It fetches data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and lets you explore Pokémon with search and sorting.  
The app is also a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — meaning you can install it on your phone for a native-app like experience! 🎉
